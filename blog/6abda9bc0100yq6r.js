The children will have their\ncelebration on their corresponding floor; Koalas, Rabbits and\nPenguins on the 2<sup>nd</sup> floor/ Bears and Giraffes on the\n3<sup>rd</sup> floor. Their teachers will have some fun movement,\nmusic and art activities prepared.</p>\n<p>Halloween is also about dressing up in funny costumes, so if\nhave something at home that your child may want to wear for the\nparty, please send it in the morning and leave it in their cubbies\nfor later on.</p>\n<p>You are welcome to join us (if you have the time) to <b>help</b>\nby playing with a group of children or being part of our fun\nactivities. Our parties will start at 2:30 and finish at 4:00.</p>\n<p>We will provide fruit and milk as refreshments during the\nparties and we have put up a food list on the door of the\nchildren’s coatrooms so you can sign up to bring something (in the\nmorning) to share with the rest of the children during the\nparties.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>During this week we have had a lot of children absent due to\nbeing ill. We would like to ask all parent to re-read our sick\npolicy and also to consider that if your child is not their usual\nself, <b>even if</b> they may not have a fever, they may still be\nill and this will affect their whole day; if they are coughing a\nlot and have a running nose, and they are low in energy please keep\nthem home until they are well enough to be around the other\nchildren. We hope that everyone gets well soon so they can all join\nus again during the next week!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We would like to welcome Maria Murphy and Alicia Mason who will\nbe joining our team staring this Monday, we are very happy to have\nthem as part of our growing family!</p>\n<p>In addition, we would like to let you know that Susan Kim,\nteacher in the Bears group, won’t be staying with us. We wish her\nall the best!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We would like to remind you that next Friday, November\n4<sup>th</sup>; the pre-school will be closed due to Staff\nDevelopment day.</p>\n<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>\n<p><b>Koalas</b></p>\n<p>Hello Koalas! We had a smaller group this week, but we still\nmanaged to have fun!&nbsp; We hope all of our sick\nfriends are feeling better and will be back for our Halloween\ncelebration next Monday.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On Monday we continued with our body and senses theme and\ndiscussed sound.&nbsp; We sang loud and soft, listened\nto different kinds of music, and played a game where you stop\ndancing when the music stops.&nbsp; On Tuesday Lina\nfrom the Rabbits class brought her guitar and Elizabeth brought her\nviolin, and we had a big circle in the afternoon with all of the\ndownstairs children, listening and exploring the different\ninstrument sounds.&nbsp; We were amazed at how all the\nchildren sat very quietly and listened to the\ninstruments.&nbsp; We will definitely have more musical\nafternoons in our future.&nbsp; Following this, we\ntried to bring all the body parts together on Wednesday by singing\n\"head shoulders knees and toes\" and songs about the\nface.&nbsp; We also continued to play the dance and\nstop game, trying to increase the wait time to help foster\npatience.&nbsp; Getting ready for Halloween on Thursday\nwe used paint and glue to make pumpkin faces out of paper\nplates.&nbsp; Our classes were so small we were able to\njoin with the Rabbits and have fun playing with the neighbour\nchildren.&nbsp; Last Friday our Swedish circle time was\nsuch a big hit we continued this Friday again.&nbsp;Swedish Friday will be a regular addition to our activities from\nnow on.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Don't forget to check out the details of our Halloween party in\nthe general part of the newsletter.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Rabbits</b></p>\n<p>Our Rabbits have been small in numbers this week, sadly we have\na few children; some away on a trip and some sick at home,\nhopefully next everyone they will be back to join-in again.</p>\n<p>The Rabbits were able to join in the fun with the Koalas and\nplay and work together this during different art, music, circle and\noutdoor activities. It was great to see them interact together with\nthe other children and teachers.</p>\n<p>It was also very nice to have individualized time with the\nchildren and work on developing their cooperative play skills by\ntaking turns and being creative when building, dancing, drawing and\nplaying!</p>\n<p>We have almost completed our PTA Meetings and we would like\nthank you all for being present and on time during these meetings,\nyour cooperation and our team work is what makes these meetings\nsuccessful. If still have your child’s portfolio at home we kindly\nask to bring it back on Monday.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Penguins</b></p>\n<p>This week the Penguins were let loose with scissors for the\nfirst time. For some of the children it was the first time that\nthey had held them and used them in their life. All of the children\nwere introduced how to hold a pair of scissors, safety issues, and\nhow to manipulate their motor skills to be able to open and shut\nthe blades. They started with using these skills to cut a length of\nstring into small pieces, which was held taut by the teacher. This\nin itself was tricky; just getting the angle of the blades right,\nand being able to have enough strength in the fingers to be able to\nshut them with enough force was no easy task for such small\nfingers. Some children then progressed on to holding the string\nwith one hand and cutting with the other, and then on to cutting\naround the edges of paper. It was amazing to see all of the\nchildren so concentrated in what they were doing and wanting to use\nthe new skills that they had learnt over and over again until they\nfelt that they have mastered the technique.</p>\n<p>Rebecca and Alfonso hope that you haven’t forgotten to take home\nyour child’s portfolio, and don’t forget to leave it again on\nMonday. There is a special section at the back of each folder where\nyou, the parents and your child can add things that you think will\nhelp show your child’s development over time. For example, if you\nhave been practicing cutting at home, why not put this in the\nfolder, or maybe photos of things they like to do etc.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Bears</b></p>\n<p>Another lovely week has passed and the children have been using\ntheir creative side.&nbsp; We have finished some of our\nsilk paper trees, we have been doing some Halloween pumpkins out of\npaper plates and other Halloween decorations, as well as, an autumn\npainting using brown and orange colours, glitter and some leaves\nthat we gathered a couple of weeks ago.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately there have been a lot of children away this week\ndue to illness, if you notice that your child is not his or her\nusual self please let us know and if he or she is sick we recommend\nthey stay home.During our Circle Time routine we have been incorporating new\nvocabulary words related to weather. The children have been invited\nto participate by recognizing these words as they point to them and\nname the weather cards that go with our daily weather chart. They\nare using their sense of sight by looking out the window and\ninterpreting what they see and answering the question “What’s the\nweather like today?”</p>\n<p>This week we have been focusing on pronunciation both in English\nand Swedish using our alphabet cards and the book called “A, B, C”\nby Dr. Seuss.</p>\n<p>On Monday it is Halloween and we are going to have a Halloween\ndisco in the big gymnasium on the 3rd floor from 2.30-4.00 and we\nhave put up a food list on the door of the children’s coatrooms.\nYou are very welcome to join us in our fun activities on Monday. If\nyou want to you can bring a Halloween costume for your child to\nwear at the disco. We will have face painting, decorating pumpkins\nand other fun activities.</p>\n<p>The IDP-meetings went well and I hope that you all feel\nsatisfied with the plan that we created together. If there is\nanything else you want to bring up or if you have any questions\nfeel free to come and talk to me about it.</p>\n<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>\n<p><b><font color=\"#0609E8\">Giraffes</font></b></p>\n<p><font color=\"#0609E8\">It's so&nbsp;wonderful to see\nyour children doing so well and making weekly\nprogress.&nbsp; Most of our IDP meetings have taken\nplace, the rest we shall be covering\nsoon.&nbsp;</font></p>\n<p><font color=\"#0609E8\">We continued with our autumn and Halloween\ncrafts throughout the week.
